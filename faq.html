        detail: `
          The TJ TECH GROUP considers that the basic values shared by management and employees are: professional commitment, respect for others, integrity, loyalty, and teamwork. These principles must be followed by us all.
          <br>
          <b>Professional commitment</b> means using the full ability, knowledge and know-how of each person, together with training to keep up-to-date. It means there must be a personal commitment and strong desire to do the tasks assigned and to acquire knowledge necessary to do the job\
          <br>
          <b>Respect for others</b> is an absolute necessity for the professional and personal development of each person. It implies an acceptance of other cultures and people of all origins. It is expressed by showing the wish to listen to others, to inform, to explain, and to engage in communication.
          <br>
          <b>Integrity</b> requires a strict adherence to honesty in all professional activities. It means that no individual may compromise the interests of the Group entrusted to that individual in favour of his or her own private interests – whether in dealing within TJ Tech Group or in dealing on behalf of the Group with third parties, whatever local practices might be. 
          <br>
          <b>Loyalty</b> requires honesty and fairness in dealing with superiors, colleagues, subordinates and third parties dealing with the Group. In particular, the pursuit of self-interest which conflicts with the goals of the TJ Tech Group is not allowed. It means following the guidelines and internal rules of the Group.
          <br>
          <b>Teamwork</b> is based on a sense of individual responsibility at work, which is more important than self-centred thinking. It encourages teamwork and bringing out the best in each person, in order to achieve the innovative objectives of the Group. It means rejecting management or operational methods which are structured more to the self-satisfaction of individuals rather than the interests of the TJ Tech Group.
