            |       There has been quite a splash when it comes to the influence of Big Data in FinTech. Technology is advancing at an exponential rate, with far-reaching repercussions. Increasing complexity and data production are changing the way companies work, and the financial industry is no exception. Automatic trading, which heavily depends on AI and bots, and trading based on machine learning remove the human emotion aspect from the equation. At the present, inexperienced traders can also employ tactics designed to help them make trades without bias or illogical swings.

Financial institutions are looking for innovative methods to harness technology to enhance efficiency in the face of rising competition, regulatory limits, and client demands.
