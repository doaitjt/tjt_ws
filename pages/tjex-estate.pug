            | Real estate investment has always been attractive, but the problem is that private investors cannot easily invest. Why? For real estate prices to rise, the country&apos;s economy needs to continue to develop. In general, the rate of increasing in real estate prices is linked to the forecast of GDP growth. This phenomenon occurs as developing countries continue their transition to becoming developed countries.
