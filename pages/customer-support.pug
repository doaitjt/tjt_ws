                        | According to the clients demand, they can choose to outsource the Customer Support function which is responsible for handling queries from users through email. For example, if a customer makes a deposit and the money got delayed to arrive in their Account balance, normally resulting in a complaint through email, our operational team will be responsible for tracing the transaction, justify the account balance and respond to the customer.
